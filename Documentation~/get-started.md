## **Known Issues and Limitations**  
**"These issues are known and are currently being addressed by the Lingotion development team. If you find any other issues, please create a new issue through the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Lingotion/lingotion-thespeon-unity/issues/new)."**

1. The first synthetization has higher latency and performance impact than subsequent synthetizations due to initializations. It is advised to make a mock synthetization once before running the intended syntheses.
2. Adaptive frame insertion for increased real-time performance may cause delays or stuttering in audio after numerous inferences. A temporary workaround until this is fixed is to restart the Thespeon Engine.
3. Heteronyms will be supported soon but is not supported in this release. The Thespeon Engine might therefore synthesize heteronyms incorrectly. As a workaround you can insert your heteronym words in separate segments with custom phonemization IPA text to get the correct pronunciation. Examples:
